* v1.0: Initial release
  - Activate the Locked Slots control for the player's inventory. Shout out to [Khaine](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19558-khaines-a19-modlets-bigger-backpacks-backpack-buttons-hp-bars-etc/) who 
    provided us with stashing buttons before b177. b177 introduced the stashing buttons for everyone, but I was missing the Locked Slots control and was not patient enough to wait for Khaine to update
    his modlet.
