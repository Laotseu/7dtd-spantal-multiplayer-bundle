Wasteland Only Valley
=====================

These filles are a 7 DAys to Die generated world where there is only one biome: Wasteland. I've also tweaked the generation to include all the ore types. Oil Shales are not present in normal wasteland biome.


How to install
--------------

The world is available as a multipart ZIP file. I had to split the ZIP since GitHub only file smaller then 100 MB. 
1. [Download all the files](https://github.com/Laotseu/7dtd-spantan-multiplayer-bundle/tree/master/Worlds) in the same folder and double-clic on the .ZIP file to extract.
2. Copy the **Wasteland Only Valley** folder that you've just extracted in your **7 Days To Die\Data\Worlds** folder. You'll have to check with your Steam client to know where 7 Days is installed.

3. Start 7 Days and create a new game using the **Wasteland Only Valley**.

4. Play the game.
5. ...
6. Profit (Maybe, mostly horrible death by vaultures and bears. Don't say you were not warned.).
